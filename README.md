## What is the P (SUCC / PRED) programming language and plang?

Use **plang** to experiment with algorithms written in P - a theoretical language used during the undergraduate courses in computer science. Unfortunately, the documentation and source comments are entirely in Swedish. Interested in a translation? Drop me a message!

Don't forget to take a look at the examples! Anything calculable can be done in P since it's turing complete - a good (and somewhat amazing!) example of this is the [cosine calculator](plang/examples/cos.p) (using [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series)).

**Features:**

* Abstract Syntax Tree generation
* Virtual Machine for running and debugging P programs
* Assembly x86 output
* Compilation to stand-alone executables
