# Examining the P Programming Language

## P (SUCC / PRED) language compiler

För den som vill fuska i introduktionskurserna. :-) Skämt åsido; värdefullt program för att testa algoritmer i programspråket P.

Use plang to experiment with algorithms written in P (SUCC / PRED) - some theoretical language used during the undergraduate courses in computer science. Unfortunately, the documentation and source comments are entirely in Swedish. Interested in a translation? Drop me a message.

Don't forget to take a look at the examples! Anything calculable can be done in P since its turing complete - a good example of this is the [cosine calculator](plang/examples/cos.p) (using Taylor series).
